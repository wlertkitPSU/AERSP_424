## Question 5 

From question 2, if the robot that finished its task is immediately assigned a new task then it would perform another task. However, the other robots would be stuck waiting until the robot finsihed its task which would never happen if since it is reassigned a new task immediately once it's finished its current task so the other robots would never complete their tasks. 

To fix this issue, a cooldown period could be implemented where once the robot completes its task it needs to wait a certain amount of time before beginning a new task. This will allow other robots to have the chance to start and complete their tasks. Additionally, a queue-based system could be implemented where the robots waiting for the tools are placed in a queue and once the current robot with the tools completes its task the first robot in the queue can now have a chance to complete their tasks.
